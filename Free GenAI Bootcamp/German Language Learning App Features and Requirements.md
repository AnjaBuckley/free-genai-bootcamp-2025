## **Non-Functional Requirements** {#non-functional-requirements}

| NFR Category | Requirement | Example Success Criteria |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Performance** | \- The system should respond quickly to user interactions (e.g., flashcard flips, quiz submissions, or voice processing). \- Server response times for core actions should be under 2 seconds for 95% of requests under typical load. | \- **Load Test Results**: Under typical load (say, 1,000 concurrent learners), 95% of all requests complete within 2s. \- **Stress/Spike Tests**: The system gracefully handles traffic spikes (e.g., sudden surge of new users) without major outages or timeouts. |
| **Scalability** | \- The platform must handle a growing user base without significant degradation in performance. \- The architecture should support horizontal scaling (e.g., adding more server instances or container replicas). | \- **Elasticity**: The system can scale to accommodate 10,000+ concurrent learners with minimal performance impact. \- **Auto-Scaling**: Infrastructure can automatically add or remove compute resources based on real-time load metrics. |
| **Security** | \- Implement secure user authentication and authorization (e.g., OAuth 2.0, JWT tokens). \- Protect sensitive data (names, emails, assessment scores) at rest and in transit (encryption, HTTPS/TLS). \- Ensure compliance with relevant data privacy laws (GDPR). | \- **Encryption**: All user data is encrypted in transit (HTTPS/TLS) and at rest (e.g., AES-256). \- **Access Controls**: Role-based permissions (learner, teacher, admin) strictly enforced. \- **Security Audits**: Periodic penetration tests reveal no critical or high-severity vulnerabilities. |
| **Usability** | \- The app’s UI must be intuitive, consistent, and require minimal onboarding. \- Provide accessible design (WCAG 2.1 guidelines) for visually/hearing-impaired learners (e.g., screen reader support, clear color contrasts). | \- **User Testing**: High satisfaction scores on usability surveys (\>80% in user feedback). \- **Accessibility Compliance**: Conformance with WCAG 2.1 AA (or higher) for color contrast, keyboard navigation, and screen-reader support. |

## **Risks**

| Risk | Potential Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **1\. LLM Hallucinations / Inaccurate Content** | Learners receive incorrect or misleading grammar/vocabulary explanations. | \- Use a vetted LLM or domain-adapted model with guardrails. \- Allow teacher moderation of AI-generated content. |
| **2\. Large User Onboarding Spike** | Performance bottlenecks or downtime if infrastructure is not prepared. | \- Implement auto-scaling. \- Perform load and stress tests before launch. |
| **3\. Data Privacy / Compliance Issues** | Legal and reputational damage if user data is compromised or handled poorly. | \- Enforce strong encryption. \- Adhere to GDPR, CCPA, or local data protection regulations. |
| **5\. Speech Recognition Accuracy Issues** | Poor pronunciation feedback could frustrate learners. | \- Choose a reliable STT engine (e.g., Google, Amazon, or specialized vendor). \- Continually refine and retrain. |
| **6\. Inadequate User Engagement / Retention** | Users drop off if app lacks interest or robust learning paths. | \- Employ gamification (badges, XP, leaderboards). \- Regularly update content and challenges. |
| **7\. Poor Offline Mode Implementation** | Negative user experience for those with limited connectivity. | \- Prioritize essential features for offline. \- Provide clear sync flows for data once back online. |
| **8\. Complexity in Multi-Language Pairing (German-English \+ expansions)** | Increased development effort for content creation, LLM training, UI changes. | \- Start with a well-defined MVP for German-English. \- Expand gradually to other language pairs if needed. |
